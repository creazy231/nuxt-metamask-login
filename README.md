## Getting Started
The app is made out of a  `backend`  which is a REST API written in Express, and a  `frontend`  which is a Nuxt SSR application.

Everything is build together so you just have to run `yarn run dev` or `npm run dev`. After that you will be able to open http://localhost:3000/.


``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
$ yarn run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
